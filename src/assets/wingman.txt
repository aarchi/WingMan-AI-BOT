### Wingman - AI Knowledge Transfer Assistant

**Introduction**:
Wingman is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to simplify knowledge transfer and document explanation. It leverages the power of GPT-4 and Azure Cognitive Services to process, understand, and explain complex documents, business strategies, and technical content in a conversational manner.

---

### Core Features:

1. **Document Upload & Explanation**:
   Users can upload various document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT) to Wingman, which then reads and simplifies the document content. The bot breaks down technical jargon into easy-to-understand language and provides summaries for long-form content.

2. **AI-Powered Explanations**:
   Wingman uses the GPT-4 model to provide detailed yet simple explanations of document content. It can also answer user queries, such as "What is this document about?" or "Explain section 3.2 in simpler terms."

3. **Voice Integration**:
   Wingman doesn’t just provide text-based explanations; it reads out the content using Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Services. The system synthesizes text to speech with customizable voices, offering a more interactive experience. The AI is set to use a robotic voice (like "Jarvis") to speak to the user.

4. **Speech Synthesis**:
   Users can click a button to hear the document explanation or the response to a query in a robotic, human-like voice. This feature can be particularly useful for users with visual impairments or those who prefer auditory learning.

5. **Role-Based Customization**:
   Wingman tailors its responses based on the user's role. Whether you're a business leader needing an overview, a developer seeking technical insights, or a curious learner, Wingman adjusts its explanation accordingly.

6. **Interactive Chatbox**:
   The bot is integrated with a chat interface that allows users to ask questions and get instant answers. This makes it easy for users to engage and get information without needing to sift through large documents.

7. **Real-Time Document Parsing**:
   Instead of manually searching through a document, users can ask Wingman questions about specific sections or concepts, and it will provide an instant response based on the document’s content.

8. **Multilingual Support**:
   Wingman is designed to understand and explain documents in various languages, making it an ideal solution for multinational corporations or global teams.

### How Wingman Works:

1. **Document Upload**:
   Users upload a document to Wingman, either by dragging and dropping or selecting from a file explorer. The bot then processes the content using GPT-4, breaking it down into digestible chunks.

2. **Interactive Explanation**:
   Once the document is processed, Wingman provides a simplified version of the content, highlighting key points and summarizing complex sections.

3. **Voice Playback**:
   Wingman offers a play button for the user to hear the explanation, utilizing Azure’s Text-to-Speech service. The user can pause, stop, or resume the playback at any time.

4. **User Queries**:
   If users need more clarification, they can type a question into the chatbox, and Wingman will return an instant, simplified answer based on the document content.

5. **AI Learning**:
   As users interact with Wingman, the bot "learns" their preferences and refines its answers for future interactions, making it an intelligent and adaptive assistant.
